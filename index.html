        <p>Parents are a child's first teacher who gives them life lessons and after them comes the Guru or teacher who leads the child ahead in life. In our young and impressionable years, our teachers played a very important role-- they have been our role models, our inspiration, and parent-figures outside of our home who taught us many lessons about life. At times they might be tough on us but, in hindsight, it was only to mould and shape our talents, to make us fight our fears and to work on our weaknesses. In fact, a good teacher not only imparts knowledge to their students but they inspire, encourage and instil curiosity to find solutions to problems.</p>
